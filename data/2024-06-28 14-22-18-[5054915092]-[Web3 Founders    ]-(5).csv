A volume bot can be made for you w/ features like referrals, MLM, priority fees, etc. that can boost your token's trading volume, enhance token and project visibility, capture the crypto community's attention, and draw investors to you.

Have created the leading volume (a bot that can buy and sell from multiple wallets acting as a market maker) bot on a network like Solana where there's lots of unsexy issues in terms of txns failure, RPC issues, etc.

So, nomatter, your token is on any chain; you could review options w/ me. Affiliates are welcome. Don't have ready-made products avail that can be given to you by doing needed configurations in 2-3 days for pennies, so if you're thinking in that direction, then big no.
